# Song-review-app
This is a song reviewing app built for one of the classes I took during my bachelor's degree.
I developed two versions of this app.<br>
The first one has a monolithic architecture with the backend wrote in Java/SpringBoot and the frontend in Angular.<br>
The second has an architecture based on microservices: <br>
* used Ruby/Rails and Java/SpringBoot for the backend services and Angular for the frontend.<br>
* All the services were containerized with docker.
